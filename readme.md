**RESTful web service client and filter implementations.**

This library provides REST utilities including
  - an abstract rest client
  - filter interfaces that may be applied to any JAX-RS (Jersey) REST service.

Filters are applied by annotation. Includes reference implementations of the following RESTful protocols and strategies:

 * MessageAddressing - REST implementation of SOAP Web Services Addressing 1.0 (WS-Addressing) protocol

## Binding JAX-RS Providers to Resource Methods

When you register providers (such as filters and interceptors) in your application theyâ€™re associated and applied to each resource method by default (bound globally). For most cases this approach is sufficient but sometimes, especially when you want to use your provider only with a few methods, JAX-RS 2.0 supports Name and Dynamic Binding.

### Name Binding

Name Binding is an annotation-driven (static) provider binding based on the JAX-RS meta-annotation `@NameBinding`. Custom binding annotations annotated with _@NameBinding_ can be later used to decorate resource classes or resource methods as well as JAX-RS providers to define associations between them.
For example, a logging filter to record incoming and outgoing communication (headers and/or entity) on our server.

```java
@Provider
@Logged
public class LoggingFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter,
                                      ContainerResponseFilter { ... }
```

Decorating this class with _@Logged_ (name binding) annotation we transformed a globally-bound provider to a name-bound one. To bind this provider to a resource method we need to decorate the method with _@Logged_ as well:

```java
@Path("helloworld")
public class HelloWorldResource {

    @GET
    @Produces("text/plain")
    @Logged                       // binds LoggingFilter to this method
    public String getHello() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}
```

Finally to create a name binding annotation from _@Logged_ just put _@NameBinding_ on top of it:

```java
@NameBinding
@Target({ ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.METHOD })
@Retention(value = RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface Logged { }
```
